                    <p> 
                    Basic commands that tell the computer processor to do something are called instructions.

                    <h4 class="text-danger"> PROGRAM [2] [072] [074] </h4>
                    <p>
                    A collection of instructions written to solve a particular problem is called program. A program is like a recipe, which contains a list of ingredients (called variables) and a list of directions (called statements) that tell the computer what to do with those variables.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="text-danger"> PROGRAMMING [1] [2074] </h4>
                    <p>
                    Process of writing instructions using a programming language is called programming or coding.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="text-danger"> PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE [2] [071] [073]</h4>
                    <p>
                    We humans use natural language such as English, Nepali, Newari etc to communicate our ideas and emotions to others. Similarly a programmer uses programming language to communicate with the computer.
                    Programming Language is the standardized communication technique between a computer and a human being. Each programming language has a set of syntactic and semantic rules used to define computer programs.

                        <h5 class="text-danger">1.	LOW LEVEL LANGUAGES</h5>
                        Low-level languages are closer to the computer hardware.<br /><br />

                        <div class="font-weight-bold">Low-level language is of 2 types</div><br />
                        <h6>a.	Machine languages / Machine code (1st GL)</h6>
                        The language in which programs are written in binary code (composed of 0 and 1) is called Machine language and it is the only one language that the processor directly understands.<br /><br />

                        <h6>b. Assembly languages (2nd GL)</h6>
                        The language in which programs are written in mnemonics (short codes) like ADD, SUB, MUL, etc. instead of writing instruction in binary numbers (0 and 1) is called Assembly language. Computer viruses are mostly written in this language. <br /><br />
             
                        <h5 class="text-danger">2.	HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGES</h5>
                        High-level languages are similar to natural language (human language) [068]. It is so called because functions used in high level programming languages are similar to the words that we use in natural language. <br />
                        <br />For example, to print the content in a standard output device (like monitor) we use printf() in C programming language, which is similar to printing a document from a printer that we may use in natural language. Also to represent integer (whole number, i.e. not a fractional number, that can be +ve, –ve or zero) variables, we use ‘int’ keyword which is also close to natural language. Program written in high-level languages are translated into machine language by a language translator called a compiler or an <b> interpreter</b>. <br /><br />         

                        <div class="font-weight-bold">High-level language is of 3 types [4] [068] [067]</div><br />
                        <h6>a.	Procedural oriented languages (3rd GL)</h6>
                        Language that follows step-by-step instruction to solve a particular problem is known as procedural language. Therefore it mainly focuses on writing the algorithm before coding.
                        In procedural oriented languages, program is divided into small parts, where each part is called a function.
                        In procedural oriented languages, importance is not given to data but to functions.
                        Procedural oriented languages follows the Top Down approach.
                        Most functions use Global data for sharing, which can be accessed freely from function to function.
                        <br />They don’t have data hiding options.
                        <br />Example: C, FORTRAN, Pascal <br /><br />

                        <h6>b.	Problem oriented languages(4th GL)</h6>
                        These languages are non-procedural languages which allow the user to specify what the output should be, without describing all the details of how the data should be manipulated to produce the result. They are result oriented, and need a translator like an interpreter or a compiler. Their main objective is to increase the speed of developing programs.
                        <br />Examples: MATLAB, Oracle, MySQL, MS-SQL<br /><br />

                        <h6>c.	Natural languages(5th GL)</h6>
                        Natural languages are still in the developing stage. On completion, we would be able to write statements that would look like normal sentences. They are designed to make computers solve problems without a programmer. They are used in the areas of research, robotics, defense system and different types of expert systems.
                        <br />Examples are LISP, PROLOG, Mercury <br /><br />

                    <h4 class="text-danger">COMPILATION PROCESS[4] [069]</h4>
                    <p>
                    The process of translation from high level language(source code) to low level language(object code) is called compilation. Compilation process consists of the following steps. 
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        <b> Source code:</b>
                        The code written by programmer using a particular programming language is called source code. Source code is the only format that is readable by humans. When we purchase programs, we usually receive them in their machine-language format. This means that we can execute them directly but we cannot read or modify them.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                        <b>Compiler:</b>
                        Compiler is a program that translates source code into object code.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                        <b>Object code:</b>
                        The intermediate code produce by a compiler is called object code. Object code is often the same as or similar to a computer’s machine language. Object code needs to be converted into executable code using linkers.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                        <b>Linker:</b>
                        A linker is a program that combines all object modules to form an executable program. We need to link a program even if it contains only one module. A linker is also called a binder.

                       <b>Note:</b> To combine the advantages of both compilers and interpreters, the program development environment of a computer system provides both a <b> compiler </b> and <b> an interpreter </b> for a high-level language. In these cases, the interpreter is used to develop and debug programs. Then, when a bug-free state is reached, the programs are compiled to increase their execution speed. Java and .NET languages use both compiler and interpreter for better performance.
