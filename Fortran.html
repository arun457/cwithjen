        <h2>Why is FORTRAN so picky about columns??</h2>
        <br />
        Fortran originated in the days of punched cards.  Each card had a total of 80 columns and represented one line of code. When you typed something incorrectly at the keypunch, you had to start that line all over with a new card.
        <br /><br />
        The next step was to give the deck of cards to a computer operator to load into a card reader. Then the computer operator would hand you back your cards and you would go off and return some time later (the following day usually) to get a printout of your results (or errors).
        <br /><br />
        Then you'd go to the keypunch, make new cards with whatever changes you wanted to make and begin the process all over again. Hope this gives you a bit of appreciation for progress!
