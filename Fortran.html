            <h2>Why is FORTRAN so picky about columns??</h2>
            <br />
            Fortran originated in the days of punched cards. Each card had a total of 80 columns and represented one
            line of code. When you typed something incorrectly at the keypunch, you had to start that line all over with
            a new card.
            <br /><br />
            The next step was to give the deck of cards to a computer operator to load into a card reader. Then the
            computer operator would hand you back your cards and you would go off and return some time later (the
            following day usually) to get a printout of your results (or errors).
            <br /><br />
            Then you'd go to the keypunch, make new cards with whatever changes you wanted to make and begin the process
            all over again. Hope this gives you a bit of appreciation for progress!
