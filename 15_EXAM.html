             A Null Pointer is a pointer that does not point to any memory location, instead pointer is initialized either with NULL or 0 explicitly to indicate that this pointer variable is still unused.
             And it is a standard practice to use a NULL constant rather than 0.  <br /><br />

            <u>  <b> Example of Null Pointer  </b> </u> <br />
            #include < stdio . h>  <br />

            <u>  <b> Output: </b> </u> <br />
            C programming is easy  <br /><br />

            <u>  <b> Discussion </b> </u> <br />
            According to C Coding standards,  <br /><br />

            NULL is the pointer whose value is equivalent to 0 (Zero).  <br />
            And 0 (Zero) value is FALSE in C and other non-zero value is TRUE. <br /><br />

            Hence if !(not operator) is applied to NULL (FALSE), it implies that !NULL is TRUE <br />
            So, if block statement is executed and "C programming is easy" is printed.
